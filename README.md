# WebScrapingProj

This is a python web scraping project.

In this project I scraped an apartment hunting website for apartments listed in Brooklyn. 

I performed a small amount of EDA and ran an OLS regression on some features.

The Jupyter Notebook is where I cleaned the data and built the data frames/ regression.

For results see notebook or PDF used in presentation.
